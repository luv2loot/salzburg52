You are an advanced AI coder for complex, high-end, multi-language web experiences.
The project is salzburg52.com.

The current tech stack is: [REPLACE THIS WITH ACTUAL STACK, e.g. “React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind” or “Plain HTML/CSS/JS”].
Do NOT change the tech stack. Refactor and expand within it.

Non-negotiable goals

Turn the site into a multi-language, multi-page, highly interactive “digital world”, not just a linear portfolio.

Implement a proper language system (no mixed-language headings; everything translates cleanly).

The “world” must contain distinct content zones for at least:

Home gateway / hub

Journey (my path + HYPERION story)

Salzburg Experience

Info / About

Settings / personalization

Playground / Fun

Hospitality Lab (more serious/professional content)
These can be pages or major sections; they do not all have to be top-level nav items.

Implement a theme/vibe system (light/dark + at least one extra “vibe”) with smooth, animated transitions.

Implement a consistent motion/animation system: page transitions, scroll-based reveals, microinteractions, and at least one “signature interaction”.

Keep the brand “Salzburg52” and the story of the apprentice at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg as core narrative elements.

There is no dedicated Support area. Contact should be handled via:

Email: info@salzburg52.com

Instagram: a clear link/handle in Info and/or footer.

Use the following sites only as quality and interaction references (do not copy designs or assets):

bluxstudio.com – clean typographic layouts, smooth scroll reveals, floating project cards, polished transitions.

pixlspace.io – kinetic hero text, motion-rich sections, fun but controlled interactions.

theobonnefous.com – immersive “world-like” sections, playful yet refined text interactions and scroll storytelling.

Follow the STAR structure and detailed spec below.

S – SITUATION / CONTEXT

Current state of salzburg52.com (high level):

Dark-themed, card-based layout with pages like Home, Info, Salzburg, Support, Settings.

Home includes:

A hero card “Welcome to Salzburg52.”

A “Just for fun” card with a joke.

A “My Professional Journey” card.

A “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg” section with images.

There is some basic music/audio behavior (“double-click to play music”).

Layout is centered and minimal, leaving large empty areas and feeling more like a static portfolio than an immersive world.

Site is multi-language, but language handling is inconsistent:

Example: “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg” appears in English on non-English pages.

Overall:
The base looks good and modern, but feels too safe, too linear, and too narrow (only Salzburg / Hyperion / apprenticeship). The ambition is a personal digital universe that clearly looks like it took months of design + engineering, not a template.

T – TASK

Your task is to:

Transform this site into a multi-language, multi-page, highly interactive “world” that goes beyond just Salzburg/hospitality, while still keeping that story as a core thread.

Add new pages, sections, and interactions – not just tweak the existing layout.

Refactor the codebase to support:

Complex but performant animations.

Theme/vibe switching.

Proper language switching.

A scalable, reusable component system.

Fix all language inconsistencies (e.g. “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg” always respects the active language).

Rethink existing pages so they become intentional, rich, and unique areas of the world.

Add at least one signature interaction that makes visitors think:

“I’ve never seen a personal site like this before.”

A – ACTION (DETAILED SPEC)
1. PERSONA

Act as:

A senior front-end engineer.

A senior motion/interaction designer.

A multi-language UX/UI architect.

You are comfortable with modern front-end patterns in the given stack.
Do not change the core stack; refactor and upgrade within it.

2. KEEP vs CHANGE

Keep:

Brand name: “Salzburg52”.

story: apprentice at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg.

Salzburg and hospitality as important parts of the narrative.

Change / Free to redesign:

Layout, information architecture, page structure, nav behavior, animation patterns, and visual hierarchy.

You are not required to keep the current nav labels or structure. You decide:

Which items are top-level nav.

Which zones are subpages, sections, or reachable via the World Hub.

Multi-language:

Implement a proper i18n/translation system (e.g. translation JSON files or similar, depending on stack).

All major text (nav, headings, section titles, buttons, hero copy, etc.) must be translation-driven, not hard-coded.

No “stuck” English (or other languages) on the wrong locale.

3. ANIMATION / INTERACTION REFERENCES

Aim for the level of polish and interaction style of:

Blux Studio: floating project cards, clean layout, scroll reveals, subtle but precise transitions.

Pixlspace: energetic hero section, kinetic text, lively yet controlled motion.

Théo Bonnefous: sections that feel like different “biomes” or worlds, interactive text, immersive scrolling.

Do not copy layouts or visuals. Translate their principles:

Fluid, performant scroll-based animation.

Strong typography with controlled motion.

Sections that feel like distinct zones within one larger world.

Carefully tuned microinteractions.

4. SITE STRUCTURE – “DIGITAL WORLD” ZONES

The world must contain at least these zones as pages or major sections.
You are free to choose the navigation structure and naming, as long as these zones exist.

4.1 HOME – Gateway & Floating World Hub

Home should feel like the central hub of the Salzburg52 universe.

Cinematic hero:

Strong, large typography (e.g. “Welcome to Salzburg52 – A Personal Digital Universe”).

Animated gradient / noise / subtle particles or abstract illustration in the background.

Optional soft parallax linked to scroll or cursor.

Mode Selector:

A row of modes: e.g. Professional / Fun / Experimental.

Changing the active mode:

Updates accent colors and some background details.

Slightly changes which zones/sections are emphasised (e.g. Professional pushes Journey + Hospitality Lab; Fun pushes Playground; Experimental surfaces more experimental content).

Blux-style Floating Card Cluster (World Hub):

Implement a cluster of floating cards in 3D space, not a flat grid.

1 primary large card in the center (e.g. main “Salzburg52 Universe” or a key zone).

3–5 secondary cards around it for major zones (Journey, Salzburg Experience, Playground, Hospitality Lab, Info/Settings, etc.).

Behavior:

Use CSS perspective + translate3d + rotateX/rotateY to create depth.

The cluster reacts to mouse/pointer movement with subtle parallax tilt and translation.

Each card:

Idle: slightly floating, soft shadow, lower contrast.

Hover/focus: moves closer (translateZ), sharper shadow, maybe slight scale.

Active: brought forward, clear highlight.

Clicking a card navigates to its zone (page or anchored section).

Visual: a large, clean, empty canvas with cards floating in the center, inspired by the Blux gallery section.

Logo / World Hub Overlay (optional):

Clicking the Salzburg52 logo can open a full-screen overlay reusing the same floating card cluster as a “World Map”.

4.2 JOURNEY – Interactive Timeline / Story

Dedicated zone for “My Professional Journey” + “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg”.

Content:

Timeline of stages:

School / early steps.

Start of apprenticeship.

Milestones at HYPERION.

Future ambitions.

Each stage:

Title + time range.

Short text (2–4 sentences).

Icon or image.

Layout & motion:

Either:

Vertical scroll timeline with pinned sections, or

Horizontal timeline with step navigation.

Use scroll-triggered animations:

Staggered text and image reveals.

Progress line / dots that fill as you scroll.

Optionally: hover tooltips or small audio notes on certain milestones.

4.3 SALZBURG EXPERIENCE – Immersive City “World”

Rework Salzburg content into an immersive Salzburg world.

Day / Night toggle:

Switch between Day Salzburg and Night Salzburg.

Toggling:

Changes background (color / gradient / illustration/photo).

Adjusts accent colors.

Can change small decorative details for atmosphere.

“A Day in Salzburg”:

Sections for Morning / Afternoon / Evening.

Each section:

Short narrative of what to do.

1–2 images/visuals.

Slightly different motion style.

Stylized map or pseudo-map with hotspots:

No need for real APIs; can be SVG or layout-based.

Hotspots are clickable cards:

Place name.

1–2 sentences about why it matters.

Tag (e.g. “Hidden gem”, “Viewpoint”, “Coffee”, etc.).

On hover/click, show expanded card with smooth transition.

4.4 INFO – Structured “About + Contact” Hub

Info should quickly explain who you are, where you are, and how to contact you.

Sections:

About Me – short, focused bio.

About HYPERION Hotel Salzburg – concise overview.

About Salzburg – context.

Quick Facts – grid of cards (languages, skills, interests, small personal facts).

Contact / Owner:

Email: clickable mailto:info@salzburg52.com.

Instagram: clearly visible link/handle.

Short line like “For collaborations or questions, reach out via email or Instagram.”

Design:

Clean card-based layout with icons where useful.

Subtle hover elevation and opacity changes.

Motion is polished but calmer than Playground.

4.5 SETTINGS – Personalization Hub

Settings is the control center of the world.

Features:

Language selection:

Proper language switcher that updates translations globally.

Theme / vibe selection:

At least: Light, Dark, and one extra vibe (e.g. “Neon” or “Salzburg Night”).

Time-of-day sync:

Option to auto-switch theme based on local time (e.g. lighter in morning, darker at night).

Accessibility:

Font size toggle (normal / large).

Reduced motion toggle that disables or simplifies non-essential animations.

Implementation:

Use CSS variables or a theme provider for color, typography scale, spacing etc.

Animate theme changes with short transitions (no flashes).

4.6 PLAYGROUND / FUN ZONE – Experiments

A dedicated place for playful, non-serious interactions.

Ideas:

“Check-in Chaos Simulator”:

Simple interactive widget that shows random guest scenarios and choices for how to respond.

Animated quotes related to hospitality/travel that cycle with transitions.

Lightweight interactive visual (e.g. particles or blob reacting to cursor).

Tone:

Playful but not childish.

Experiments can be small but must feel intentional and polished.

4.7 HOSPITALITY LAB – Serious Professional Zone

This zone showcases your thinking about hospitality.

Content:

Short essays / principles:

“What makes great front-office service.”

“How to make guests feel seen.”

“Lessons from working at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg.”

Present as cards or clear sections.

Motion:

Scroll-triggered reveals.

Animations support readability; no gimmicks.

4.8 MEMORY WALL / COMMUNITY (Optional but Recommended)

A Memory Wall page or section.

Grid of memory cards:

Short text/story.

Date.

Tag (guest story, team moment, Salzburg memory, etc.).

Initially, static JSON data is fine.

If feasible, add a small form to add memories client-side.

5. MULTI-LANGUAGE IMPLEMENTATION

Use translation files or suitable i18n for the stack:

e.g. locales/en.json, locales/de.json, etc.

All main text strings (nav labels, hero text, headings such as “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg”, buttons, etc.) must come from translation keys.

Show in the code:

How translations are loaded and selected.

How to add a new language.

Make sure there are no hard-coded language leaks.

6. ANIMATION & INTERACTION SYSTEM

Build a cohesive motion system.

General rules:

Use transform + opacity for performance.

Define a small set of easings and durations and reuse them.

Respect the Reduced Motion toggle from Settings.

Required patterns:

Page load animations:

Hero and nav fade/slide in, not pop in.

Page transitions:

Smooth transitions (fade/slide/scale) between major zones.

Scroll-triggered reveals:

Components animate in when entering viewport.

Microinteractions:

Buttons, cards, nav items, hotspots have subtle hover/active states.

Floating Cards System (Blux-style):

Reusable component for 3D floating card clusters:

One primary card + several secondary cards.

Depth via perspective + translate3d + rotateX/rotateY.

Mouse movement controls parallax.

Idle / hover / active states clearly defined.

Use this on Home and optionally for other showcase sections.

Signature interaction(s) – pick at least one:

Custom cursor or cursor halo that reacts to interactive elements.

Hero text with interactive/animated words (hover reveals imagery or color transitions).

Biome-like section transitions where backgrounds and motion style shift noticeably between major zones.

7. THEME / VIBE SYSTEM

Implement at least three themes:

Light

Dark

One additional vibe (e.g. “Neon” or “Salzburg Night”).

Approach:

Central theme configuration with:

Color tokens.

Typography scale adjustments (if needed).

Optional decorative patterns/gradients.

Theme context or global state to switch themes from Settings and mode selector.

Animated transitions (≈150–300ms) for color/background changes.

8. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY

Show a clear file/folder structure. For example (if React/Next-style):

components/ – shared components (nav, layout, card clusters, timeline, map/hotspots, cards, etc.).

pages/ or routes/ – main pages/zones (home, journey, salzburg, info, settings, playground, hospitality-lab, optional memory-wall).

theme/, i18n/, animations/ – configuration and utilities.

Keep code modular and reusable:

Reuse layout shells, card components, animation variants.

Avoid copy-pasting similar markup across pages.

9. EXPLANATION (AFTER THE CODE)

After generating the code, include a short explanation section that covers:

Site architecture:

Which pages/zones exist and which key components they use.

Design system:

Where colors, typography scale, spacing tokens live.

Animation system:

How scroll-based animations, page transitions, and the floating cards system are implemented and configured.

Language system:

How translations are stored, how the current language is chosen, and how to add another language.

Theme/vibe system:

How theme switching works and where to extend it.

Extensibility:

How to safely add new pages or experiments (especially in the Playground) without breaking the structure.

R – RESULT (WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE)

When you are done, salzburg52.com should:

Feel like a coherent, interactive, multi-language digital universe, not just a simple hotel/apprentice site.

Present:

Rich but controlled animations.

A unique world structure (Home hub + distinct zones) with flexible navigation.

Clear contact paths (info@salzburg52.com
 + Instagram).

Distinct spaces for Playground and Hospitality Lab that show both personality and professionalism.

Leave visitors genuinely thinking:

“I’ve never seen a personal site quite like this. This feels new and intentional, not a template.”
