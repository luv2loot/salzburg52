PROMPT START

S – SITUATION / CONTEXT
You are a coder for complex, high-end, multi-language web experiences. The project is salzburg52.com.

Current state (based on design and structure):
- A dark-themed, card-based site with pages: Home, Info, Salzburg, Support, Settings.
- Home has: 
  - A hero card “Welcome to Salzburg52.”
  - A “Just for fun” card with a joke.
  - A “My Professional Journey” card.
  - A section “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg” with images.
- There is some music/audio behavior (“Double-click to play music”).
- Layout is centered and minimal but leaves a lot of empty space and feels more like a nice static portfolio than a unique, immersive experience.
- There are multiple languages, but not all content respects the designated language. For example, the section title “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg” is in English on non-English pages.

Overall: it’s a good-looking base, but too safe and too focused only on Salzburg / Hyperion Hotel / hospitality / apprenticeship. The owner wants this to feel like a “digital universe” that looks like it took months of thought, not a simple website.

T – TASK
Your task is to:
1. Transform this website into a multi-language, multi-page, highly interactive “world” that goes far beyond Salzburg/hospitality.
2. Add new pages, new sections, new interactive and visual ideas, not just small tweaks.
3. Refactor the code (from bottom to top if needed) to support:
   - Complex animations.
   - Theme/vibe switching.
   - Language switching.
   - A scalable component system.
4. Fix language consistency (e.g., “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg” should match the page language).
5. Rethink pages like Info, Salzburg, Support, Settings so they feel intentional, rich, and unique.
6. Add at least one “signature interaction” that makes people say: “I’ve never seen a site like this before.”

A – ACTION (DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS)

PERSONA
Act as:
- A senior front-end engineer.
- A senior motion designer.
- A multi-language UX/UI architect.
You are comfortable working with HTML/CSS/JS, TypeScript, React, or similar. If the existing project uses a framework (React, Next.js, etc.), keep it but refactor heavily. If it is plain HTML/CSS/JS, modernize and modularize it.

CONTEXT (WHAT YOU SHOULD KEEP / CHANGE)
- Keep: brand name “Salzburg52”, the idea of professional/apprentice at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg, the concept of Salzburg and hospitality as part of the story.
- Change: everything else is fair game. You can redesign layouts, nav, animations, interactions, and even restructure pages.
- Ensure multi-language support is coherent:
  - Fix mismatches like English headings on non-English pages.
  - Build a simple language system so copy can be easily translated and swapped.

TASK (SITE STRUCTURE & FEATURES TO BUILD)
Redesign the site as a small “digital world” with these areas:

1. HOME (Gateway)
   - Cinematic hero: stronger visuals, maybe animated gradient or subtle video/illustration.
   - A “mode selector”: Professional / Fun / Experimental (or similar).
     - Each mode slightly changes:
       - Accent colors.
       - Background animation.
       - What sections are highlighted first.
   - Quick entry cards to:
     - Journey
     - Salzburg Experience
     - Hospitality Lab
     - Playground
     - Settings

2. JOURNEY (New page)
   - Move the “My Professional Journey” content and “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg” into a full interactive timeline/story.
   - Scroll or horizontal timeline with:
     - Stages of the apprenticeship.
     - Photos, icons, short reflections.
   - Use scroll-triggered animations, staggered entries, and clear storytelling.

3. SALZBURG EXPERIENCE (Rework Salzburg page)
   - Not just static info. Create:
     - Day/Night toggle (and theme reacts to it).
     - Interactive map or pseudo-map with clickable hotspots (places, tips, mini stories).
     - A “Day in Salzburg” section (morning / afternoon / evening) with different visual and motion styling.

4. INFO (Rework Info page)
   - Turn it into a structured “About + Quick Facts” hub:
     - About Me (short bio).
     - About HYPERION Hotel Salzburg (short, focused).
     - About Salzburg.
     - Quick facts cards (small bite-sized info).
   - Use cards, icons, small illustrations, and subtle hover effects.

5. SUPPORT (Reposition)
   - Option 1: Keep as a page but:
     - Add FAQs, contact options, quick links (Settings, email, etc.).
   - Option 2 (recommended): Move support content into:
     - A “Support & Help” section inside Settings, and
     - A footer link or a floating “Help” button.
   - Either way, make support feel integrated, not an afterthought.

6. SETTINGS (Central personalization hub)
   - This page should handle:
     - Language selection (multi-language switcher).
     - Theme/vibe selection (Light / Dark / maybe extra “Neon / Retro / Minimal” modes).
     - Time-of-day sync option (site automatically adapts theme to local time).
     - Accessibility options (font size, reduced motion toggle).
     - Support & Help if you relocate Support here.
   - Animate theme changes smoothly: use CSS variables or theme provider to transition background and text colors, not hard cuts.

7. PLAYGROUND / FUN ZONE (New page)
   - A dedicated area for playful experiments:
     - Small interactive jokes/games related to hospitality or travel.
     - A “Check-in Chaos Simulator” or some small interactive element that’s fun but lightweight.
     - Animated quotes, micro canvases, or a simple WebGL/canvas visual that responds to cursor/scroll.

8. HOSPITALITY LAB (New page)
   - A more serious/professional zone:
     - Short insights, mini essays, or “principles of great hospitality.”
     - Present them as cards or sections with scroll-based reveals.
   - This keeps the site professional and gives depth to your role as an apprentice.

9. MEMORY WALL / COMMUNITY (Optional but recommended)
   - A simple “Memory Wall” where future guests, friends, or you yourself can add little memory cards (even if just client-side/dummy data for now).
   - It adds a feeling of growth and life to the site.

EXEMPLAR (QUALITY BAR)
Use as reference the level of craft from:
- Apple product pages (smooth motion, simplicity with depth).
- Stripe/Linear-style marketing pages (clean, modern, slightly futuristic).
- Webflow/awwwards-style creative portfolios with:
  - Scroll-triggered storytelling.
  - Microinteractions.
  - Complex but tasteful animations.

Don’t copy them visually. Aim for that level of polish and intentionality.

TONE
- Code + comments: clear, concise, professional.
- UI copy: friendly, slightly playful, but still mature. 
- Avoid cringe, but do allow a bit of personality in “Fun/Playground” areas.

FORMAT & RESULT (WHAT YOUR OUTPUT MUST LOOK LIKE)

1. CODE STRUCTURE
   - Show a clear file/folder structure.
   - Break UI into reusable components (if React/Next/etc.).
   - Use modern CSS (or Tailwind) and keep styling organized.
   - If using animation libraries (Framer Motion, GSAP, etc.), integrate them cleanly.

2. MULTI-LANGUAGE IMPLEMENTATION
   - Explain how text is stored (e.g., in JSON, in translation files, etc.).
   - Show how to:
     - Add a new language.
     - Translate major UI strings (nav, buttons, headings like “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg”).
   - Ensure no heading is stuck in the wrong language.

3. ANIMATION & INTERACTION SYSTEM
   - Use consistent easing and duration ranges.
   - Prefer transform/opacity for performance.
   - Implement:
     - Page-load animations.
     - Scroll-triggered section reveals.
     - Microinteractions on buttons, cards, nav elements.
     - Optional: custom cursor halo or another signature interaction.

4. THEME & VIBE SYSTEM
   - Implement light/dark + at least one extra “vibe” theme.
   - Theme switches should be animated smoothly.
   - Document where in the code themes are defined and how to add another one.

5. EXPLANATION
   - After the code, briefly explain:
     - The site architecture (pages and components).
     - The design system (colors, typography scale, spacing).
     - The animation system (how it’s wired).
     - The language system.
     - The theme/vibe system.
     - How to add new pages or experiments without breaking the structure.

R – RESULT (WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE)
When you’re done, salzburg52.com should feel like:
- A highly interactive, multi-language digital universe, not just a hotel/apprentice site.
- A site that looks like it took months of design and engineering:
  - Rich but controlled animations.
  - Unique navigation and structure.
  - Surprising “Playground” and “Lab” areas.
- Something where a visitor genuinely thinks:
  “I’ve never seen a personal site quite like this. This is new.”

Now I will paste the current codebase. Transform it according to everything above.
