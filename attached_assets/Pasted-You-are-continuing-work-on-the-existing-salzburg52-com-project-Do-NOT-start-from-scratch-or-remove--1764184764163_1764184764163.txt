You are continuing work on the existing salzburg52.com project.
Do NOT start from scratch or remove the new “digital world” structure you already implemented.
Only refine and extend what’s there.

Apply the following changes and fixes to the current codebase:

1. Remove all “Coming Soon” UI

Find every section, card, or text that says something like “Coming soon” or is clearly a placeholder section with that label.

Remove those “Coming soon” blocks from the visible UI:

Either delete those sections or replace them with real content/empty but clean layout.

Do NOT break routing or the page structure; just remove the unfinished “Coming soon” messaging from the interface.

2. Fix Instagram link

Anywhere you link to Instagram, update the URL to:

https://instagram.com/am.rsbgg

Keep the visible label as “Instagram” (or its translated variants), but ensure the href points to am.rsbgg.

3. Keep the “System” appearance setting

In the Settings / Appearance area, ensure that:

The System theme option (appearance based on OS/system preference) is still available and works.

Do NOT remove or downgrade this option when you modify themes.

If you changed theme logic in previous steps, verify:

Light / Dark / any extra themes still work.

System theme still respects the user’s OS theme where applicable.

4. Add animations to gallery and all main sections/subpages

Right now, Home and the digital world hub have strong animations. Extend this to other sections:

Gallery / image sections (e.g. “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg” gallery or similar):

Add scroll-based animations (fade/slide-in) and subtle hover motion.

Animations should feel similar to Home/Journey (same general timing/easing) but not identical copy-paste; vary direction, delay, or scale slightly.

All main subpages/zones (Journey, Salzburg, Info, Playground, Hospitality Lab, etc.):

Ensure each page has consistent section reveal animations:

On scroll into view: fade/translate, with sensible stagger.

On hover: cards/buttons lift slightly and feel alive.

Reuse the same animation system/helpers you already created, so it stays consistent and easy to maintain.

The overall goal: the whole site should feel animated and cohesive, not just the Home world hub.

5. Fix “Journey” navigation from the digital world

On the digital world / floating cards hub (Home):

When the user clicks the Journey card, they should be navigated to the dedicated Journey page/route that you already created.

If that route exists but isn’t wired, fix the link.

If the card currently does nothing (or just scrolls nowhere), hook it up to the correct page.

6. Apply the same design & animation improvements to Info

Make sure the Info page benefits from the same design quality and animation system as Home / Journey:

Use the updated card styles, spacing, and animations.

No “old-looking” sections left over from the previous design.

The “Learn more” button / link in “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg”:

Right now it leads to nothing or to a dead end.

Make it navigate to the Journey page (or to a clearly defined section of that page).

Overall, Info should feel like part of the same digital world, not an older leftover page.

7. Day/Night behavior and time-based theme

Right now the Salzburg Day/Night implementation is a manual toggle. I want BOTH:

7.1 Time-based global theme switching

Implement a feature that changes the global theme based on the user’s current local time.

Example logic (you can adjust, but keep it simple and documented):

“Day” theme between roughly 06:00 and 18:00

“Night” theme outside that range

Integrate this with the existing theme system:

If the user selects System or a manual theme override in Settings, that preference should still be respected.

If useful, add an explicit “Auto (by time)” theme mode in Appearance settings:

When Auto is selected, use time-based logic.

When a manual theme is selected, ignore time-based switching.

7.2 Separate day/night activities on the Salzburg page

Keep the manual Day/Night toggle on the Salzburg Experience page, but make it meaningful:

Under Day, show daytime activities / places.

Under Night, show night activities / places.

The local Salzburg page styling should change between Day and Night:

Background and accent colors adjust to match the mood.

This content toggle is independent of the global theme:

Even if the global theme is in “Night” mode, the user can manually switch the Salzburg content to view “day activities” and vice versa.

In short:

Global theme: can change automatically by time of day (with user control).

Salzburg page: Day/Night toggle controls the content and local styling for activities.

8. Check-in Chaos Simulator – readability per theme

In the Playground / Check-in Chaos Simulator, the answer options are currently hard to read.

Fix this so the answers are clearly readable in all active themes:

Ensure text color has enough contrast against its background in Light, Dark, and any extra vibe themes.

If needed, adjust:

Background surfaces (e.g. darken/lighten cards depending on theme).

Text color tokens.

Hover/selected states, so selected answers are still readable.

Use your existing theme tokens (e.g. variables or design system) so this stays consistent and easy to maintain.

After changes, the simulator should feel visually clear and usable, not washed out or low contrast.

9. Cursor visibility on dark pages

The custom cursor is currently too dark on dark pages and hard to see.

Update the cursor styling so it is always clearly visible, regardless of theme/background:

For dark backgrounds, the cursor should be lighter or have a clear outline/glow.

For light backgrounds, ensure there is still enough contrast (e.g. darker cursor with light border or shadow).

You can:

Make the cursor theme-aware (different variants per theme), or

Use a single design with a border/halo that makes it visible on both light and dark surfaces.

Keep the overall aesthetic consistent with the current design, just improve visibility and usability.

10. After changes – quick summary

When you’re done, briefly summarize in the chat:

Which files you changed.

How:

Animations are now wired into gallery/sections/subpages.

Journey and “Learn more” navigation now work.

Day/Night behavior + time-based theme switching is implemented.

Check-in Chaos Simulator readability was improved for all themes.

Cursor visibility was improved on dark pages.

Any known limitations or TODOs you left.

Do NOT remove any of the main structures (Home world hub, Journey, Salzburg, Info, Playground, Hospitality Lab, etc.).
Just refine and fix according to the points above.
