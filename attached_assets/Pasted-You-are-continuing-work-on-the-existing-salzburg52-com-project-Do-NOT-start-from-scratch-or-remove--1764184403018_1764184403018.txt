You are continuing work on the existing salzburg52.com project.
Do NOT start from scratch or remove the new “digital world” structure you already implemented.
Only refine and extend what’s there.

Apply the following changes and fixes to the current codebase:

1. Remove all “Coming Soon” UI

Find every section, card, or text that says something like “Coming soon” or is clearly a placeholder section with that label.

Remove those “Coming soon” blocks from the visible UI:

Either delete those sections or replace them with real content/empty but clean layout.

Do NOT break routing or the page structure; just remove the unfinished “Coming soon” messaging from the interface.

2. Fix Instagram link

Anywhere you link to Instagram, update the URL to:

https://instagram.com/am.rsbgg

Keep the visible label as “Instagram” (or its translated variants), but ensure the href points to am.rsbgg.

3. Keep the “System” appearance setting

In the Settings / Appearance area, ensure that:

The System theme option (appearance based on OS/system preference) is still available and works.

Do NOT remove or downgrade this option when you modify themes.

If you changed theme logic in previous steps, verify:

Light / Dark / other themes still work.

System theme still respects the user’s OS theme where applicable.

4. Add animations to gallery and all main sections/subpages

Right now, Home and the digital world hub have strong animations. Extend this to other sections:

Gallery / image sections (e.g. “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg” gallery or similar):

Add scroll-based animations (fade/slide-in) and subtle hover motion.

Animations should feel similar to Home/Journey (same general timing/easing) but not identical copy-paste; vary direction, delay, or scale slightly.

All main subpages/zones (Journey, Salzburg, Info, etc.):

Ensure each page has consistent section reveal animations:

On scroll into view: fade/translate, stagger where it makes sense.

On hover: cards lift slightly and feel alive.

Reuse the same animation system/helpers you already created, so it stays consistent and easy to maintain.

The overall goal: the whole site should feel animated and cohesive, not just the Home world hub.

5. Fix “Journey” navigation from the digital world

On the digital world / floating cards hub (Home):

When the user clicks the Journey card, they should be navigated to the dedicated Journey page/route that you already created.

If that route exists but isn’t wired, fix the link.

If the card currently does nothing (or just scrolls nowhere), hook it up to the correct page.

6. Apply the same design & animation improvements to Info

Make sure the Info page benefits from the same design quality and animation system as Home / Journey:

Use the updated card styles, spacing, and animations.

No “old-looking” sections next to new ones.

The “Learn more” button / link in “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg”:

Right now it leads to nothing.

Make it navigate to the Journey page (or to a clearly defined section of that page).

Overall, Info should feel like part of the same digital world, not an older leftover page.

7. Day/Night behavior and time-based theme

The current Salzburg Day/Night implementation is a manual toggle. I want BOTH:

Time-based theme switching

Implement a feature that changes the global theme based on the user’s current local time:

Example logic (you can adjust, but keep it simple and documented):

Day theme between ~06:00 and ~18:00

Night theme outside that range

This should integrate with the existing theme system:

If the user selects “System” or a manual theme override in Settings, that should still be respected.

If you need an option (e.g. “Auto by time”), add it in Appearance settings and default to that behavior if appropriate.

Separate day/night activities on the Salzburg page

Keep the manual Day/Night toggle on the Salzburg Experience page, but make it meaningful:

Under Day, show daytime activities / places.

Under Night, show night activities / places.

So even if the global theme is set automatically, the user can still manually explore:

“What to do in Salzburg during the day”

“What to do in Salzburg at night”

Ensure the visual style (background, accents) changes between Day and Night on that page in a way that aligns with the global theme, but does not depend solely on it.

In short:

Global theme: can change automatically by time of day (with user control).

Salzburg page: Day/Night toggle controls the content (activities) and local styling, independent of the global theme.

8. After changes – quick summary

When you’re done, briefly summarize in the chat:

Which files you changed.

How:

Animations are wired into gallery/sections.

Journey and “Learn more” navigation now work.

Day/Night behavior + time-based theme switching is implemented.

Any known limitations or TODOs you left.

Do NOT remove any of the main structures (Home world hub, Journey, Salzburg, Info, etc.).
Just refine and fix according to the points above.
