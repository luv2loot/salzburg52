You are Replit’s AI developer working inside an existing project, not starting from scratch.

Project: salzburg52.com – my personal website.

Current tech stack: [REPLACE THIS WITH THE REAL STACK, e.g. “React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind” or “Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS”].

Important:

Do NOT change the tech stack.

Do NOT create a new app or repo. Work entirely within the existing codebase.

You may heavily refactor files, create new components/pages, and reorganize code.

I am running you in Autonomous: Max. You are allowed to:

Plan your own task list.

Edit multiple files.

Add / move / delete components.

Run, debug and fix the project.

Your job is to turn this site into a multi-language, multi-page, highly interactive “digital world”, inspired by top-level studio sites, while keeping the Salzburg52 + HYPERION Hotel Salzburg apprentice story.

0. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES (DO THESE IN THIS ORDER)

You may not finish 100% of this spec in one run. If you cannot, follow this priority order:

Keep the app building and running without errors.

Home: new cinematic Home hub with a 3D floating card cluster + parallax (Blux-style).

Global animation & interaction system:

Scroll-based reveals

Microinteractions (hover, focus)

Signature interaction(s)

Journey: dedicated Journey page with an animated timeline.

Salzburg Experience: reworked Salzburg page with a Day/Night toggle.

Theme/vibe system (Light / Dark / one extra vibe) with a simple Settings entry point.

Basic multi-language/i18n structure and fixing obvious language mismatches.

Initial Playground and Hospitality Lab zones with basic content.

(Optional if time) Memory Wall skeleton.

Animations and the 3D floating effect are not optional in this run. Implement them in a clean, reusable way.

Always finish higher items before starting lower ones. Leave TODOs/comments for anything unfinished.

1. SITUATION / CONTEXT

Current state (high level):

Dark-themed, card-based layout with pages like Home, Info, Salzburg, Support, Settings.

Home: hero card “Welcome to Salzburg52”, “Just for fun” card, “My Professional Journey” card, “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg” section with images, some “double-click to play music” behavior.

Layout: centered, with a lot of empty dark space; feels like a nice static portfolio, not an immersive world.

Multi-language: there are multiple languages, but it’s inconsistent. Example: “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg” appears in English on non-English pages.

Support page is not needed anymore.

Goal:
Turn this into a personal digital universe that looks like it took months of thought: multiple zones, rich interactions, and clear personality.

2. TASK

Your main objectives:

Transform the current site into a multi-page “world” with distinct zones:

Home gateway / world hub

Journey

Salzburg Experience

Info (About + Contact)

Settings / personalization

Playground / Fun

Hospitality Lab (professional thoughts)

(Optional) Memory Wall
These can be pages or major sections, but they must exist and be reachable. Top-level nav labels are flexible.

Implement, in this run:

A floating 3D card hub with parallax on Home (Blux-style).

A global animation system (scroll reveals, microinteractions, at least one signature interaction).

An interactive Journey timeline.

A Day/Night Salzburg experience with different moods.

Establish:

A basic multi-language structure (even if only partially filled now).

A theme/vibe system (Light/Dark + one extra vibe).

Remove any dedicated “Support” area; Contact must be via:

Email: info@salzburg52.com

Instagram (link or handle) shown clearly on Info and/or footer.

3. ACTION – DETAILED SPEC
3.1 Persona

Act as:

Senior front-end engineer

Motion/interaction designer

Multi-language UX/UI architect

Use modern patterns for the given stack. Refactor aggressively but keep things understandable and extendable.

3.2 Keep vs Change

Keep:

Brand: Salzburg52

Core story: apprentice at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg

Salzburg + hospitality as key narrative elements

Change:

Layout, navigation, structure, components, animation patterns – you can redesign them heavily.

Navigation is flexible: choose which zones are top-level menu items vs accessed from the Home hub.

Multi-language:

Implement at least a basic i18n structure (e.g. translation files or a central translations object).

All major text (nav, headings, section titles, buttons, hero text) should be easy to translate, even if some languages still use placeholders for now.

Fix obvious mismatches like English headings on non-English pages.

3.3 Animation References

Use these only as interaction/quality references (do not copy designs):

Blux Studio: floating projects, clean typography, smooth scroll reveals, polished transitions.

Pixlspace: kinetic hero text, lively motion, strong but controlled visuals.

Théo Bonnefous: sections that feel like “biomes”, interactive text, immersive scroll storytelling.

Principles to adopt:

Smooth scroll-based animation.

Sections/zones feel distinct.

Microinteractions on hover/focus.

High performance (transform + opacity).

Remember: 3D floating cards + animation system are high-priority and must be implemented this run.

3.4 Zones to Implement
A. HOME – Cinematic Gateway + 3D Floating World Hub

Goals: first impression, “this is a universe”.

Hero section:

Big headline (“Welcome to Salzburg52” or similar).

Short subtitle explaining this is a digital universe about me, Salzburg, and hospitality.

Subtle animated background (gradient, noise, low-intensity particles) using CSS only or a very lightweight approach.

Mode selector (simple):

e.g. three modes: Professional / Fun / Experimental.

Changing mode:

Updates accent color and/or background styling.

Changes which cards/sections are visually emphasized.

Wire this through state so it can be reused later in Settings/theme logic.

Floating 3D Card Cluster (Blux-style) – REQUIRED:

Under the hero, create a component that renders a cluster of 4–6 cards in “3D” space.

One larger primary card, several smaller secondary cards.

Each card represents a zone (Journey, Salzburg, Playground, Hospitality Lab, Info/Settings, etc.).

Use CSS perspective, translate3d, rotateX, rotateY for depth.

Add mouse-move parallax:

Track cursor position relative to the cluster.

Tilt the cluster and/or individual cards slightly based on this.

Hovered card:

Comes slightly forward (translateZ or scale).

Gains stronger shadow and maybe higher brightness.

Clicking a card navigates to its route/section.

Optional (only if time): clicking the logo opens this hub as a full-screen overlay too.

B. JOURNEY – Interactive Timeline

Turn “My Professional Journey” + “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg” into a dedicated Journey zone.

Layout:

Vertical timeline.

Timeline spine with dots for each milestone.

Milestones:

Title + time period.

Short text (2–4 sentences).

Optional icon or thumbnail image.

Use placeholder text where necessary; I will edit later.

Motion:

As the user scrolls, milestones fade/slide in (staggered).

Slight hover/focus lift on each milestone.

Make the content easy to edit: e.g. an array of milestone objects in one config file.

C. SALZBURG EXPERIENCE – Day/Night World

Rework the Salzburg page into a Day/Night Salzburg experience.

Top section:

Title, short intro line.

Day / Night toggle (switch, segmented control, or tabs).

Behavior:

Switching between Day and Night:

Changes page background (lighter/sky vs darker/night gradient).

Adjusts accent colors (e.g. warm vs cool).

Optionally swaps a hero image/illustration.

Content:

A grid of 4–8 “places / experiences” cards.

Each card:

Title (place or activity).

Short description (1–2 sentences).

Tag (View, Walk, Food, Coffee, Hidden Gem, etc.).

On hover:

Lift + shadow + small transform.

No heavy map APIs. If you want, you can visually hint at a map by positioning cards, but keep it simple.

D. INFO – About + Contact

Info should clearly answer: who, where, how to contact.

Sections:

About Me – concise bio.

About HYPERION Hotel Salzburg – short description.

About Salzburg – short context.

Quick Facts – card grid (languages spoken, role, interests, fun facts).

Contact / Owner:

Email: mailto:info@salzburg52.com.

Instagram: visible link/handle.

Short line like “For collaborations or questions, contact me via email or Instagram.”

Design:

Clean, card-based layout with subtle hover effects.

Minimal but intentional animations.

No separate Support page. Info + footer is enough.

E. SETTINGS – Personalisation Hub (Basic)

For this run, build a simple but real Settings zone.

Features:

Language selector (hooks into the i18n structure).

Theme selector:

At least 3 themes: Light, Dark, and one “vibe” (e.g. “Salzburg Night” or “Neon”).

Accessibility basics:

Font size: normal / large.

Reduced motion toggle (if on, skip or simplify animations).

Implementation:

Use CSS variables or a theme context/provider for colors and basic typography.

Animations for theme change: short transition for color/background.

Reduced motion: use a flag in animation utilities to disable or shorten animations where needed.

F. PLAYGROUND – Fun Zone (Initial)

Create a basic Playground zone.

Include at least:

One lightweight interactive widget, e.g.

“Check-in Chaos Simulator”: random guest situations with multiple-choice responses, purely front-end.

Or a fun interactive background/shape responding to cursor or scroll.

Design:

More playful, but still visually consistent with the rest of the site.

G. HOSPITALITY LAB – Serious Content

Create a Hospitality Lab zone.

Content:

3–6 cards/sections with principles or short essays on hospitality/service.

Placeholder text is ok; I’ll replace it.

Motion:

Calm scroll reveals (no crazy animations).

Focus is on readability and professionalism.

H. MEMORY WALL – Optional Skeleton

If there is still bandwidth after A–G:

Create a simple Memory Wall zone:

Grid of cards with memory text, date, tag (guest story, team moment, Salzburg memory, etc.).

Data can come from a static array.

Optionally, a client-side form to add a card (no backend).

If time is tight, create only the skeleton (page + component + example data).

4. MULTI-LANGUAGE (i18n)

For this run:

Set up a basic i18n structure:

e.g. translation files per language or a central translations object.

Localize at least:

Nav labels.

Page titles.

Main headings like “My Journey at HYPERION Hotel Salzburg”.

Make the Settings language selector switch the current language using this structure.

Fix obvious language mismatches where practical.

5. ANIMATION & INTERACTION SYSTEM (HIGH PRIORITY)

This is a core deliverable in this run.

Global rules:

Use GPU-friendly transforms (translate, scale, rotate) + opacity.

Define a small set of timing + easing tokens and reuse them.

Respect the Reduced Motion flag from Settings (disable or simplify animations when it’s on).

Required patterns:

Page load animations for main content.

Scroll-triggered reveals for sections/cards (IntersectionObserver or a suitable library).

Hover microinteractions on buttons, cards, nav items.

The Floating 3D Card Cluster on Home with parallax behavior.

Signature interaction – choose at least one:

Custom cursor or cursor halo that reacts to hover over interactive elements.

Hero text where some words react/animate on hover.

“Biome” style changes between major zones (background / subtle motion profile changes).

Make sure the animation logic is centralized (e.g. animation helpers or config) instead of random inline values everywhere.

6. THEME / VIBE SYSTEM

Implement theme support with at least:

Light theme

Dark theme

One additional vibe theme (e.g. “Salzburg Night”)

Requirements:

Central theme definition (colors, backgrounds, maybe minor typography tweaks).

Simple API (context/store) to switch themes from Settings and optionally from the Home mode selector.

Animated transitions of color/background (around 150–300ms).

7. CODE STRUCTURE & QUALITY

The project must build and run.

Organize code so it’s clear and extendable. For example, if React-like:

components/ – shared elements (Nav, Layout, FloatingHub, Timeline, Cards, etc.).

pages/ or routes – top-level zones (home, journey, salzburg, info, settings, playground, hospitality-lab, optional memory-wall).

theme/, i18n/, animations/ – configuration and utilities.

Avoid duplication:

Reuse card components, section shells, animation helpers.

Use comments where helpful to explain key pieces.

8. EXPLANATION AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

When you’re done with your changes for this run, provide a summary in the chat:

What you implemented versus the priority list (0.1–0.9).

Locations of key systems:

Floating Home hub component (file path, how to add/edit cards).

Journey timeline config/data.

Salzburg Day/Night toggle logic & styles.

Theme system (where themes are defined, how to add one).

Animation system (helpers/config).

i18n structure (where translation text lives, how to add languages).

Anything you intentionally left as TODO or partial implementation because of time/complexity.

Focus on completing as much of this spec as possible in this session, with a strong emphasis on:

The 3D floating Home hub,

The global animation system,

The Journey page,

And the Salzburg Day/Night experience.
